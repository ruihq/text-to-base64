## Usage

To use this script, simply run it from the command line. You will be prompted to choose whether you want to encode or decode a text. If you choose to encode, you will then be prompted to enter the text you want to encode. The script will then print the base64 encoded string of the entered text.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the script to encode a text:

```
python3 encoder.py
Enter 'e' to encode or 'd' to decode: d
Enter the base64-encoded text to decode: SGVsbG8gV29ybGQh
Hello World!
```

In the first example, the script was run and the user chose to encode a text. The user entered `"Hello World!"` as the text to encode. The script then printed the base64 encoded string `"SGVsbG8gV29ybGQh"`.

In the second example, the script was run and the user chose to decode a text. The user entered `"SGVsbG8gV29ybGQh"` as the base64 encoded text to decode. The script then printed the decoded string `"Hello World!"`.
